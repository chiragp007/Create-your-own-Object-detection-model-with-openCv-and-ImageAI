# Create-your-own-Object-detection-model-with-openCv-and-ImageAI

1) create model with ImageAI
2) use that model in openCv (WEBCAM)

# In first phase,
         -: If data is not labeled then use "labelimg" and label your data(this step is very important, check video on youtube               how to do that)
         -: After label you data , you will have XML of all images
         -: create folder (annotations and images) [E.g, cardDetection-:(annotations,images)]
         -: put your Images in "images" folder and it's XML in "annotations" folder
         -: "pretrained-yolov3.h5" download this from internet
         -: check version of tensorflow
         -: now, set your path and run your script
         
# phase two,
         -: after first phase, you will have many models
         -: download the latest one
         -: set path and load the model
         -: use that model into the OpenCv
         -: we have a result
